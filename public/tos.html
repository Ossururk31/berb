    <p
      >Welcome to Berb. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to
      and use of the Berb web application (the "Service"). By using Berb, you
      agree to be bound by these Terms.</p
    >

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p
      >Berb is a web-based platform that allows users to send and receive files
      via peer-to-peer (P2P) connections using WebRTC. Files are transferred
      directly between users and are not stored on Berb's servers.</p
    >

    <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p
      >You may use Berb only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these
      Terms. You agree not to use Berb to:</p
    >
    <ul>
      <li
        >Transmit any content that is illegal, harmful, defamatory, or
        obscene</li
      >
      <li>Infringe on the intellectual property or privacy rights of others</li>
      <li
        >Distribute malware or engage in phishing or unauthorized access to
        systems</li
      >
      <li
        >Interfere with or disrupt the security, integrity, or performance of
        the Service</li
      >
    </ul>

    <h2>3. No File Storage</h2>
    <p
      >Berb does not store or retain any user files. All file transfers occur
      directly between sender and recipient via end-to-end encrypted
      peer-to-peer connections. Once a session is closed, all file data is
      permanently inaccessible to Berb.</p
    >

    <h2>4. No Warranty</h2>
    <p
      >Berb is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any
      kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the Service will
      be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.</p
    >

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p
      >To the maximum extent permitted by law, Berb and its developers shall not
      be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
      punitive damages arising out of or relating to your use of the Service,
      including but not limited to data loss, unauthorized access, or file
      corruption.</p
    >

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p
      >The Berb name, logo, and website design are the property of the
      developers of Berb. All rights reserved. You may not copy, modify, or
      distribute the service or any part of it without permission.</p
    >

    <h2>7. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p
      >We may update these Terms from time to time. Any changes will be posted
      on this page with a revised effective date. Your continued use of the
      Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new
      Terms.</p
    >

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p
      >We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service
      at our sole discretion, without notice, if we believe you have violated
      these Terms.</p
    >

    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
    <p
      >These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
      laws of the jurisdiction where the service is operated. Disputes shall be
      resolved in the appropriate courts of that jurisdiction.</p
    >
