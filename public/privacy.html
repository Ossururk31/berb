    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 1, 2025</p>

    <p
      >Berb is a peer-to-peer file transfer platform that enables users to send
      files securely and directly from one device to another using WebRTC
      technology. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect
      your information when you use Berb.</p
    >

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p
      >Berb is designed to maximize user privacy. All file transfers are
      conducted directly between users using end-to-end encrypted WebRTC
      connections. Files are <strong>never stored</strong> on our servers, and
      Berb does not require an account to use the core functionality of the
      app.</p
    >

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p
      >While Berb does not store files or collect personal information for
      transfers, we do collect certain types of data to maintain the service and
      improve user experience.</p
    >

    <h3>2.1 Signaling Data</h3>
    <p
      >To initiate a peer-to-peer connection, Berb uses a temporary signaling
      server to exchange network metadata (such as IP addresses, session
      descriptions, and ICE candidates). This information is:</p
    >
    <ul>
      <li>Ephemeral (not stored or logged)</li>
      <li>Used solely to establish the connection between peers</li>
      <li>Deleted immediately after the connection is established</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Analytics Data</h3>
    <p
      >We use analytics tools such as Google Analytics, Vercel Analytics, or
      similar services to gather anonymous usage data, including:</p
    >
    <ul>
      <li>Page views and session duration</li>
      <li>Browser and device types</li>
      <li>Interaction events (e.g., file sent, transfer completed)</li>
      <li>Geographical location (country-level)</li>
    </ul>
    <p
      >This data helps us improve the app, fix bugs, and understand how users
      interact with Berb. Analytics data is collected in aggregate and does not
      include file contents or identifying personal information.</p
    >

    <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p
      >Berb may use cookies or localStorage for essential site functionality,
      such as remembering user settings or session state. We do not use cookies
      to track users across other websites.</p
    >

    <h2>4. File Transfers</h2>
    <p
      >All file transfers through Berb use WebRTC technology, which includes
      built-in end-to-end encryption (DTLS/SRTP). Files are streamed directly
      from the sender to the receiver and are never uploaded, cached, or stored
      on any intermediary server operated by Berb.</p
    >

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p
      >Since Berb does not store user files or account data, there is no
      persistent personal data to retain. Analytics data may be retained
      according to the policies of the third-party providers used (e.g., Google
      Analytics). We do not retain signaling metadata after the connection is
      established.</p
    >

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p
      >Berb may rely on third-party services for analytics, infrastructure, or
      error reporting. These may include:</p
    >
    <ul>
      <li>Google Analytics</li>
      <li>Vercel (hosting and serverless functions)</li>
      <li>Cloudflare (for content delivery and DDoS protection)</li>
    </ul>
    <p
      >These providers may collect anonymized data as part of their service
      delivery. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for more
      information.</p
    >

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p
      >We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the
      integrity and confidentiality of your data. WebRTC connections are
      encrypted, and we do not store transmitted files. However, as with any
      internet-based service, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p
    >

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p
      >Berb is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not
      knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe a
      child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we
      will delete it promptly.</p
    >

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p
      >We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      posted on this page with a revised effective date. Your continued use of
      Berb constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p
    >

      data, you can contact us at:</p
